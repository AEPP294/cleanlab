    "# Finding Label Errors in Token Classification Datasets \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how you can use cleanlab to find potential label errors in text datasets used for the NLP task of token classification. In token-classification, our data consists of a bunch of sentences (aka documents) in which every token (aka word) is labeled with one of K classes, and we train models to predict the class of each token in a new sentence. Example applications include part-of-speech-tagging or entity recognition, which is the focus on this tutorial. Here, we use CONLL-2003 named entity recognition dataset which contains 20,718 sentences and 301,361 tokens, where each token is labeled with one of the following classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LOC (location entity)\n",
    "- PER (person entity)\n",
    "- ORG (organization entity)\n",
    "- MISC (miscellaneous other type of entity)\n",
    "- O (other type of word that does not correspond to an entity)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview of what we'll do in this tutorial:** \n",
    "- Identify potential token label issues using cleanlab's `token_classification.filter.find_label_issues` method. \n",
    "- Rank sentences using cleanlab's `token_classification.rank.get_label_quality_scores` method. \n",
    "- TODO: (Clean Learning) Train a more robust model by removing problematic sentences. "

To detect potential labels issues, we first get `pred_probs` and `labels`, which are both in nested-list format, such that: \n",

Each row of the matrix corresponds to a token `t` and contains the model-predicted probabilities that `t` belongs to each possible class, for each of the K classes. The columns must be ordered such that the probabilities correspond to class 0, 1, ..., K-1. \n",
    "        \n",
    "- `labels` is a list of lists, such that `labels[i]` is a list of given token labels of the `i`'th sentence. For dataset with K classes, labels must be in 0, 1, ..., K-1. All the classes (0, 1, ..., and K-1) MUST be present in ``labels[i]`` for some ``i``. \n",

Given that each sentence has different number of tokens, we store `pred_probs` and `labels` as `.npz` files, which can be easily converted to dictionaries.
