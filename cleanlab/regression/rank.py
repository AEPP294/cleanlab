    """
    Returns label quality score for each example in the regression dataset.

    Each score is a continous value in the range [0,1]
    1 - clean label (given label is likely correct).
    0 - dirty label (given label is likely incorrect).

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : np.ndarray
        Raw labels from original dataset.
        1D array of shape ``(N, )`` containing the given labelsÂ for each example (aka. Y-value, response, target, dependent variable, ...), where N is number of examples in the dataset.

    predictions : np.ndarray
        1D array of shape ``(N,)`` containing the predicted label for each example in the dataset.  These should be out-of-sample predictions from a trained regression model, which you can obtain for every example in your dataset via :ref:`cross-validation <pred_probs_cross_val>`.

    method : {"residual", "outre"}, default="outre"

    Returns
    -------
    label_quality_scores:
        Array of shape ``(N, )`` of scores between 0 and 1, one per datapoint in the dataset.

        Lower scores indicate datapoints more likely to contain a label issue.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from cleanlab.regression.rank import get_label_quality_scores
    >>> labels = np.array([1,2,3,4])
    >>> predictions = np.array([2,2,5,4.1])
